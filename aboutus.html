    <h1>What does this do?</h1>
    <h2>This project will find the businesses that are the closest to your values, this could be vegan, local, or fresh foods.
        The algorithm will provide a catalog of businesses in Calgary(where I live) that matches best of what you want.</h2>
    <br></br>
    <h1>How to use it?</h1>
    <h2>Easy! Place in words that you want to see from a local food and drinks business and hit the search button. The system will find a catalog of businesses that have the highest alignment.</h2>
    <br></br>
    <h1>Why was this made?</h1>
    <h2>In the time of the coronavirus, local businesses are struggling to stay on their feet and sustain themselves. In addition, it is harder to find businesses that are authentic and true to their values. When you put in a google search for a local restaurant, you would find places like Edo Japan, Chopped leaf and other large corporate organizations. The current issues with the search methods out there is that it is hard to gain publicity as a small business and still be aligned with your values. With this project, I created an algorithm to determine the best local restaurants that are aligned with your values with the small dataset provided. </h2>
    <br></br>
    <h1>I'm not getting the results I want!</h1>
    <h2>Currently, I am using a small database of local businesses in Calgary to gain all the locations. There is a chance you wonâ€™t find the business due to the data being too small for the time being.</h2>
