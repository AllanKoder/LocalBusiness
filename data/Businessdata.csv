"Allium
","An elevated plant-based restaurant focusing on ethical, local, creative food and libations.","The Allium is rooted in principles of radical humanism and co-empowerment, connected to substantive liberty and community socio-economic development. As a non-capitalist worker owned business, working-class members are proportionately rewarded for their efforts. Collective ownership over profits means the more you work the more you earn (and the less you work the less you earn).

Plant-based means The Allium cares for the planet and all life (human and animal). The restaurant does not exchange with giant corporate producers and sources locally as much as is possible, creating a more vibrant local economy with enhanced social capital networks and meaningful community connections.

The Allium aims to demonstrate an alternative form of work and economy, one where liberty and equality coexist to create more capable and empowered people, and more robust societies. The restaurant recognizes the current existence of deep structural economic issues, and rather than critique, The Allium seeks to create viable solutions outside of a linear economy and zero-sum formats, embracing and advocating diffused mutual aid. The Allium has no investors and no bosses. The Allium designed, built and now operates the business independently, free from the restraints of conventional ficing and usury debt forms that work to enervate rather than energize our communities. The restaurant recognizes ficial, but also intellectual and social capital as equally integral to the business realm.

The Allium's collective members are at the heart of our business, but so are the various community members and collaborators the restaurant interacts with daily. The Allium believes that they are capable of designing better structures today, that a better world for all is possible, and the restaurant hopes to demonstrate that, in-part, through their casual-fine dining, elevated plant-based restaurant.","211A 12th ave SW

","Bees are an important part of the environment; critical to plant pollination. Yet, their survival is threatened by disease, pesticides, parasites, and climate change.

","For thousands of years, the confluence has been a significant gathering place; It is where many world views have collided, forever changing the people and the place. The Bow and the Elbow river confluence is no exception, and laid down the foundation for modern-day Calgary. Confluence Distilling tale began in 2007 in a backyard with a 10 lb. bag of Russet potatoes, boiling water, bakers yeast and some crossed fingers. This marked the beginning of Ross’s journey into the world of distilling. Although the first (few) batches didn’t turn out too well, he was steadfast in his desire to craft his own spirits. In November 2018 Confluence Distilling opened its doors to the public.

The original team is made up of Ross (our fearless President and founder), Jamie (sales expert, growth manager and connection to the outside world) and Pheelan (the she amongst the he’s, the head taster and co-founder). All of them brought together through the love and allure of liquor. The story of Confluence isn’t only entrenched in the love of spirits and science—it’s also about a desire to create better communities and culture. Their spirits are a means for Albertans to connect with local culture, art, cocktails, and of course, each other. Their vision is to create better lives by making the good times last. Located in the inner-city district of Manchester, Confluence Distilling is proud to create premium handcrafted spirits, with locally sourced ingredients from family farmers.

The next time you have a sip, we hope you are as excited as they are about the unique flavours, the local art and the passion behind every bottle.

Goldie Craft Chocolate,"Pleasure for the People! Micro-batch craft chocolate, made from ethically sourced cocoa beans.
","Goldie Craft Chocolate believes that as conscious consumers, we do not need to compromise our ethics, in order to experience the pleasure of good chocolate! What chocolate provides is truly unique - a memory, a moment of celebration, a comforting solace. However, underneath all of this deliciousness, lies a history of chocolate farming and manufacturing that is uncertain and unethical for the majority of the worlds five million cacao farmers. Goldie Craft Chocolate aims to make great chocolate, but to do so by putting the change they wish to see worldwide, into practice.

Ethical sourcing through transparent trading ensures that no human is enslaved to grow the cacao that Goldie Craft Chocolate sources, but it doesn't stop at farmer well-being. This cacao is grown with the preservation of local flavour in mind. Each origin Goldie Craft Chocolate sources is committed to growing chocolate with care, fermenting and drying it properly, which yields a high quality premium bean. Proper growing, fermenting and drying practices are the initial building blocks of a fine flavour chocolate, and each origin will taste uniquely different. Goldie Craft Chocolate currently sources from a family owned farm in the Costa Sur region of Guatemala called Monte Grande. They also use beans from the western part of Uganda, in a place called Semuliki Forest. These beans are farmed by over 1000 smallholder farmers in the region, who deliver their fresh cacao to the network weekly, and are paid in cash at the time of sale. This offers consistent cash flow to the farmers instead of a large payout once or twice a year (which is common practice of industrial cacao purchasers)

Once Goldie Craft Chocolate has the cacao in their hands, they get to work roasting, grinding and turning the beans into chocolate bars. Because they are a very small operation of just one person, the process of making chocolate is still on a micro-batch level. Many of the machines used in their processing have been hand made or re-purposed from other kitchen uses. They use organic ingredients as much as possible, and hope to be using more local ingredients in their inclusions soon. When all is said and done, they wrap each bar in a compostable cellulose wrapper and a Canadian post-consumer waste recycled paper envelope. It takes about a week to go from bean to bar, but it is a labour of love that produces excellent quality chocolate with simple ingredients that they know you will love!",,goldiechocolate@gmail.com
